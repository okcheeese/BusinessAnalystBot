# Business Analyst Bot

This project provides a business analyst bot designed to assist entrepreneurs and business owners in developing robust business plans. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), the bot offers guidance on market analysis, target audience definition, customer acquisition strategies, revenue models, and scalability options.

When you run the bot, Flask works behind the scenes to connect the HTML and CSS components. The user sees a chat interface built with HTML and styled with CSS, while behind the scenes, Flask handles user interactions and relays information to the LLM core for analysis. The LLM's responses are then integrated back into the interface, creating a smooth and intuitive chat experience for the user.
